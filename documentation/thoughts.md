perhaps a better name is excel-code, since it uses code in excel, and provides code functions

hmm.. code is already taken us will instead use RUN.JS with the RUN.{language or code}

would be cool to have single run function instead, that way it is a bit easier to deal with.

hmm better to simply signify language with something that is part of the cell text that way an editor can pick up on it.



can pass things in with an args variable.


TypeScript?

What if you could run a cell in the editor to try things out and get error information or console log statements?
